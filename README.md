    <p>Hey you! Yes you! Consider this website an investment opportunity for none other than me and myself!</p>
    <p>If you can give me ALL of your money I PROMISE to use it for nothing but my own needs! Certainly not CHARITY! CHARITY! is overrATED!</p>
    <p>For some reason, the link to the stylesheet.css isnt working! Nothing should be wrong with it, I've run so many debug tests and it all comes perfect! Other than that I'm bloody tired! I swear I have CFS or something! Why isnt't the bloody style sheet working! Even in VSC it doesnt work! Lua betterLuabetterLuabetter!</p>
